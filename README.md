# Udacity DSND Final Project
Udacity DSND Final Project Repository

This is the repository for the final Capstone project of the Udacity Data Science Nano Degree. 

## Motivation behind the project

Having a smaller organisation we need to be clever about where we deploy resources. The project endevours to optimise lead targeting, to aid achieving a higher conversion rate to paying customers. 

Using data science I'm aiming to find ways to identify the leads that are more inclined to convert. Also atempting to identify behaviours that will lead to customer journey process changes to improve chances of conversion. 

## Executing the notebooks. 
The project is built entirely in jupyter notebooks. It is important to execute the notebooks in number order, starting with 0. The two model notebooks numbered 3 can be run in either sequence. 

## Findings and analysis 
The writeup on the project can be found at [Lunkwill and fook](https://lunkwillandfook.dev/2021/01/21/can-you-judge-a-book-by-its-cover-when-trying-to-target-potential-customers/)
